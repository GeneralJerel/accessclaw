## One-Liner

An AI-powered Chief of Staff that handles email, follow-ups, invoicing, and scheduling for solopreneur freelancers — with full real-time transparency and control.

---

## Problem

Solopreneur freelancers lose 30–40% of their working hours to administrative overhead: email triage, client follow-ups, invoice chasing, scheduling coordination, and context switching between delivery and operations. Existing tools address individual pieces but create their own cognitive burden — none provide a unified, proactive operational layer.

---

## Core Value Proposition

Replace the need for a human Chief of Staff with an AI agent that has full context of your business, acts proactively, and keeps you in control of every action before it happens.

## Core UX Principles

- **One screen, one job** — Each view has a single clear purpose with the ability to expand deeper
- **Radical transparency** — Every agent action is visible and editable before execution
- **Human-in-the-loop** — The user always has final say; nothing goes out without approval (configurable)
- **Progressive trust** — Start with full review mode, unlock more autonomy as trust builds

## Competitive Landscape

| Competitor | Gap |
|------------|-----|
| Generic CRMs (HubSpot, etc.) | Too heavy, not freelancer-specific, no AI agency |
| Scheduling tools (Calendly) | Single-purpose, no business context |
| Invoice tools (FreshBooks) | No proactive follow-up, no cross-feature intelligence |
| AI assistants (ChatGPT, etc.) | No persistent business context, no real-time action transparency |
